How contribute to PHPWord ?
---------------------------

-  Improve the documentation (`Sphinx Format <http://documentation-style-guide-sphinx.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`__)


Is this the same with PHPWord that I found in CodePlex?
-------------------------------------------------------

No. This one is much better with tons of new features that you can’t
find in PHPWord 0.6.3. The development in CodePlex is halted and
switched to GitHub to allow more participation from the crowd. The more
the merrier, right?

I’ve been running PHPWord from CodePlex flawlessly, but I can’t use the latest PHPWord from GitHub. Why?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PHPWord requires PHP 5.3+ since 0.8, while PHPWord 0.6.3 from CodePlex
can run with PHP 5.2. There’s a lot of new features that we can get from
PHP 5.3 and it’s been around since 2009! You should upgrade your PHP
version to use PHPWord 0.8+.
