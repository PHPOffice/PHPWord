### Deprecations
- Deprecate `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::getIndent()` : Use `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::getIndentLeft()`
- Deprecate `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::setHanging()` : Use `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::setIndentHanging()`
- Deprecate `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::setIndent()` : Use `PhpOffice\PhpWord\Style\Paragraph::setIndentLeft()`

### BC Breaks

### Notes
- Writer ODText previously used to set 'style:use-window-font-color' to 'true', now it is set to 'false'. (see [#2735](https://github.com/PHPOffice/PHPWord/pull/2735))
  The effect of this attribute is "implementation dependent" (if implemented at all).
  Setting it to false allows setting a default font color and improves interoperabilt,
  but may break certain specific use cases.
